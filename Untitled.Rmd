## Three-spined sticklebacks
Binomial nomenclature: *Gasterosteus aculeatus*
A small torpedo shaped fish, this fish can live in either fresh, brackish, or salt water. They are typically found only in the Northern Hemisphere where it inhabits coastal waters or freshwater bodies. It's common name is derived from the presence of three (sometimes 2-4) sharp spines on the back dorsal fin towards the head. Coloring is usually obscure; mottled brown-green coloring on the upper side of the body and a white, silvery, or yellow-ish color on the ventral side. Males posses a vivid-blue gree eye color and the breast region shows a red orange coloration.
